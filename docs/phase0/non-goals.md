# Non-Goals (Phase 0)

## Safety / Claims
- No clinical use, no medical device behavior, no diagnosis, no treatment recommendation.
- No therapeutic claims, no patient-facing outputs, no regulated decision support.
- No attempt to validate or certify scientific conclusions.

## Product Scope
- Not a fully-featured workflow engine in Phase 0 (only contracts + templates).
- Not a notebook replacement.
- Not a general-purpose “agent platform.”

## Technical Scope
- No GPU scheduling, no multi-node inference, no model serving in Phase 0.
- No vector database, no long-term “memory” store beyond artifact persistence.
- No human-in-the-loop review UI.

## Data Scope
- No handling of PHI/PII beyond what is necessary for synthetic examples.
- No expectation of secure multi-tenant isolation in Phase 0 (that is later).
